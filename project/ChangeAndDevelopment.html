                <p>When facing internal or external pressure for change we implement the Kurt Lewin Model for change. The first step of this process is to unfreeze, which is when we provide a reason for needing a change. It is important to create a minor
                    level of guilt within the organization for not changing yet to help facilitate it. The most important part of this step is to make sure everyone in the company feels secure and comfortable with the change because if this is not done
                    there will be unrest about the change and it will be harder if everyone is not on the same page about what is happening, why its happening, and how its going to happen. </p>

        <div class="col col-8">
            <p>The next step in the Kurt Lewin method of change is going forward with making the actual changes. The organization must provide information that supports the changes because if they canâ€™t back it up with any evidence then there is no need
                for any changes. Once the actual transformation starts, we must bring about shifts in the behavior of the members of our organization. Everyone must be on the same page at this step in order to make it as quick and seamless as possible.

                <p>The final step is to refreeze. This is when the organization reaps the benefits of the successful change. Before starting this step, it is important to ensure everyone is aware of the change completing and everyone is aware of what is
                    expected out of them now and what their responsibilities are. The company must also ensure that everything done remains consistent with the new identity. The whole process is one that should be done slowly but efficiently in order
                    to make sure everyone is on the same page and the company gets to where is intends to be with little to none road blocks. </p>
