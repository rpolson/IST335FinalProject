                    <p>Step one of the decision-making process is to establish the objective or goal of the decision. At this stage everyone in the group must attempt to understand the problem to be solved. It is after everyone in the group understands what
                        the problem is and what the objective of the solution is that we can move on to step 2.

                    <h3>2. Develop</h3>
                    <p>The next step is to develop some courses of action. It is important to take into consideration the desired outcome of the problem at hand. The people making decisions must determine exactly what is important in solving the problem.
                        At this level people must take in all the factors that go into making the decision and how each of those factors effect the desired outcome. It is the things researched in this step that lead to the reasoning behind the decision
                        that will be made.

                    <p>Once every factor is considered, the next step is to evaluate every possible option in search for the best available option. After collecting a wide range of alternative, it is important to carefully weigh the consequences of each.
                        It is important to not restrict thinking too much and to keep an open mind in order to harbor the most creative and effective results.

                <p>After all the alternatives have been set out, it is time to select which alternative looks like the best option. This is taking in everything that could factor into the outcome and selecting which one is the best option that leads to the
                    most production.

                <p>The best alternative is not always the option that can be picked depending on some of the circumstances regarding time constraints or monetary restrictions. At this stage the actual decision must be made as to what the organization is
                    going to do. It is important to re-examine all possible solutions before making a final decision.

                <p>The decision-making process is not over when the decision is made. The last step in the process is to implement the decision and monitor the effects that it is having on the organization. It is important that the decision produces the
                    desired outcome. If the solution did not solve the problem then there is another problem to be solved and the process starts over again.
