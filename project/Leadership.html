                <p>One of the most important aspects of an organization is its leadership plan. It sets the tone for how the organization will be run and what is to be expected out of everyone involved. Leadership styles is something that many people have
                    done studies on. One study completed at the University of Michigan suggested there was a Leadership Behavior Continuum that stretched from Close Supervision to Laissez-Faire with three other styles between those two ends. After Close
                    Supervision comes Job-Centered, then General, leading to Employee-Centered before getting to the other extreme of Laissez-Faire. As you get closer to Close-Supervision end of the spectrum it places control more and more in hands of
                    the leaders. As you move to the Laissez-Faire end there is increased employee involvement.
                </p>
                <p>The leadership style used at Medea from this study is one that is more employee-centered. This is a behavioral leadership style that follows from the belief that leaders are “born not raised.” With this style of leadership, the employees’
                    personal needs and the development of interpersonal relationships are given more of an emphasis. Under this style there is a lot of delegation and working together throughout the organization. It is this collaboration that leads to
                    the great innovation we create here at Medea. </p>
