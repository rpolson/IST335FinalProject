                        <td>A high degree of centralization is key to a healthy company culture/structure. Centralization refers to the amount of decision-making authority that is held at the top of the organization. If the decision-making power is held tightly
                            at the top level, then the direction of the company can be easily defined and the decisions made will share goals and desired outcomes keeping everyone on the same page and focused on what they need to be doing rather than
                            worrying about making decisions. </td>
                        <td>Standardization refers to the existences of rules, standard operating procedures, and routines. At Medea there is a high level of standardization. This is because higher standardization leads to more efficiency and there are less
                            surprises when it comes to what people are doing. Employees know what is expected of them and they are put in the best possible situations to succeed when everything is clear and laid out as to what the company wants from them.</td>

                        <td>When an organization has a high level of standardization, it is also helpful to have a high level of formalization. This is the extent that the rules and procedures are actually documented. Formalization ensures that there is no
                            confusion with what is expected. It also helps with liability in the case of an incident or disagreement amongst workers. Making sure there is a high level of formalization is something that sets Medea apart from the competition.</td>
                        <td>Specialization is the degree to which associates, and managers have jobs with narrow scopes and limited variety. Specialization is best when centered around mangers and associates having more narrowed scoped and focused tasks.
                            This way there is no confusion as to what is expected out of people. Also keeping tasks narrow and focused results in more people excelling at the tasks they are doing. No one is overwhelmed by what they have to do and they
                            become experts in the things that they do have to do.
